# Vanilla timer

Complexity: 25

Create a timer that consists of the following:

- An input field to input the number of minutes, the input field should be disabled when the timer starts
- A label for the input field, clicking on the label should result in the input field being focused
- A button to start the timer and it should be disabled when the timer starts
- A button to stop and reset the timer. It should be disabled by default and become clickable when the timer starts. Resetting the timer should set the value of the input field back to zero - Text to show the time left on the timer in this format: “MINUTES : SECONDS”

The timer stops and reset when time left reaches zero.
