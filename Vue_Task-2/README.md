# SVG as a component

Complexity: 5

Convert vue-logo.svg to a Vue.js Functional Single File Component (name it VueLogo.vue) with props to control the two colours.
Then in App.vue create two instances of the VueLogo.vue component. Donâ€™t pass in any props to the first one so it looks the same as the original svg file. The second one will consist of blue and red.
